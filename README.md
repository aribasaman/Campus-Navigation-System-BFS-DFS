# Campus-Navigation-System-BFS-DFS
This project is a simple Campus Navigation System developed in C++ using graph traversal techniques.
The university campus is represented as an undirected graph, where each block is treated as a node
and the walking paths between them are represented as edges.

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is used to determine the shortest walking path between two locations,
while Depth-First Search (DFS) helps identify all blocks that can be reached from a given starting point.
The program is implemented using custom queue and stack structures without using STL.

## How to Run
Compile and execute the program using:
g++ campus_navigation_system.cpp -o campus
./campus
